# Week 2 – Project Management and CLI 
At first the idea of setting up a “machine” sounds rather intimidating. Thankfully, I’m familiar with Google products and find them easy to work with, once you understand the layout.

What I find interesting about doing any type of technical work is my natural curiosity, to aks why. Why does this need to be entered this way? What will happen if I did something else instead. All I can hear is one of my professors say, “You are learning the foundations, you don’t need to know why, right now. Focus on getting familiar with how things are written and the environment and trust the process.” So, that’s the advice I am going to follow throughout this class. I’m going to trust the process and ask questions, when I’m not sure of the next step.

During this first week of discussions, I wasn’t sure how much I should contribute. I hope sharing my progress, with its little snag was sufficient.

# Week 3 – Nano Text Editors, Git, Github and Markdown 
One of the most challenging things for me has been to understand the context in which these commands will be used in the real world. Once I got into the Github and Markdown exercise, things started to make sense, because it is similar to html, but different.

When I got to the Git Configuration section, things got very interesting. First, little typos will be the death of me. Thankfully, once I typed in the correct command, things seemed to work. Until I tried to generate the SSH Keys. I asked for help, and Dr. Burns mentioned that I needed the whole key, I thought I should do a bit more research. I didn’t have a frame of reference what the SSH Key would look like, so I searched Youtube for tutorials.  I found a video that showed similar steps and what the screen looks like with a SSH key has been generated, and that made all of the difference. 

I think the repo cloning stage, commit and push exercise went smoothly.  

# Week 4 -  Search with Grep
This week was a lot easier for me, but I still need to listen and what the lectures a few times to get my bearings, before practicing the exercises.

When I went to export the Scops.bib file, I only exported the first 10, and not the 100 that were available for my search. So, I had to do that over. There were also a few times I had to double check the accuracy of my entries. Because I received an error message. 
It feels like you need the patience of a saint to do this work. 
When things did work, I was relieved. 

My favorite outputs are the ones that sorted and counted. 

# Letter Grade Suggested: A 
Grade Rationale
I allowed for plenty of time for trial and error. I went through each task, until I was successful. I asked questions, when I was unsure. I think my mini portfolio screenshots are almost 100% on the mark. I’ve done my best, and know it will get easier throughout the semester.
